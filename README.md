**Justification / What is this?**
Our project name - Junkyard Juliot, is a robotic hand controlled using an Arduino, wires, and servo motors. The hand is designed to move, making it interactive for a single user. The servo motors control the hand's motion, the Arduino acts as the brain, sending signals to the servos based on programmed instructions. Additionally, the project features a servo-controlled door that opens and closes. On top of the structure, My tead added Coke cans, possibly for weight balance or an aesthetic junkyard-inspired theme.

**Components:**
- Arduino (Uno/Mega) – The brain of the project
- Servo Motors (x4 or x5) – To control the hand's movement
- Jumper Wires – For electrical connections
- Power Source (Battery Pack or USB) – To power the Arduino
- Hand Frame ( Cardboard) – The base for the robotic hand
- String or Fishing Line – To simulate for finger movement
- LEDs & Resistors – For visual feedback
